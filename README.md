# Woz U/Infosys Projects

Here I hold my daily project solutions

## Note

Because of the use of submodules, use one of the following commands for cloning:

__HTTPS__

```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/andrewdstrain/WozU-Infosys.git
```

__SSH__

```
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:andrewdstrain/WozU-Infosys.git
```

For those that don't want to clone the submodules, here's the list so far.
